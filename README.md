Hi, I'm Siddhant, a first year B.Tech student pursuing Chemical engineering. I live in Gorakhpur,Uttar Pradesh.
I've been interested to learn more about the different aspects of coding lately. Exploring the vast world of coding and trying to find my niche, it has been quite an interesting 
journey till now and I look forward to keep exploring.

I want to contribute to open source just because I like the idea of being responsible for a change that is brought upon in the form of evergrowing technologies that makes the life of people way simpler and better. 

Talking about my hobbies, I'm not into any kind of sports. In my free time I like to watch anime and play video games.
Well ...That's all about me.
Thankyou.
